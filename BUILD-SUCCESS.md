## Known Issues

### Symbolic Link Creation Warning

During the Electron build process, you may see warnings about symbolic links:

```
ERROR: Cannot create symbolic link : A required privilege is not held by the client.
```

**Impact**: This does not affect the functionality of the built application. It's related to macOS-specific files in the code signing tools and can be safely ignored on Windows.

**Solution** (Optional): Run PowerShell/Command Prompt as Administrator to avoid this warning.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19.2.0
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.2.0
- **Desktop Framework**: Electron 38.3.0
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.8.2
- **AI Integration**: Google Generative AI (@google/genai 1.25.0)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Application is ready for use
2. ✅ Desktop executable is available at `build-output/win-unpacked/WebCrate.exe`
3. Optional: Create installer (NSIS) by modifying the build target in package.json
4. Optional: Add code signing for production distribution

## Conclusion

The WebCrate application has been successfully built and is fully functional. Both the web and desktop versions are ready to use.
